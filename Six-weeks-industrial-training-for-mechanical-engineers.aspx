<p>Mechanical engineering is a field of engineering that deals with the study and application of principles of physics, materials science for analysis, design, manufacturing, and maintenance of mechanical systems. This engineering branch includes the production and usage of heat and mechanical power for the design, production, and operation of machines and tools. Mechanical Engineering is one of the oldest and broadest engineering disciplines. <br />
<br />Mechanical engineers require an understanding of core concepts of mechanics, kinematics, thermodynamics, materials science, structural analysis, and electricity. Mechanical engineers use these core principles along with tools like computer-aided engineering and product lifecycle management to design and analyze manufacturing plants, industrial equipment and machinery, heating and cooling systems, transportsystems, aircraft, watercraft, robotics, weapons, medical devices, are basic tools that are used with core principles by Mechanical engineers.
