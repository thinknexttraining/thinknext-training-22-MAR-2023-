                                <p>Java was designed to be an independent language on any software or hardware due to the fact that the compiler then gathers the code and then converts it into a platform-independent bytecode which can be run on multiple sites.</p>

                            <div itemprop="text">
                                <p>Pointers are quite difficult and not very safe to use by beginner programmers. Java focuses on the simplicity of the code, but usage of pointers can make it complicated. Pointer utilization may cause errors leading to compromised security.</p>
                                <p>Moreover, a certain level of abstraction is equipped by not including pointers. The usage of pointers can make the procedure of garbage collection quite slow.</p>

                                <p>When discussing Java, method overloading is made possible by introducing different methods in the same class consisting of the same name, but all the functions are different in number or type of parameters. It takes place inside a class and improves  program readability.</p>
                                <p><strong>Method overriding</strong> is the concept in which two methods having the same method signature are present in two different classes.</p>

                                <p><strong>Final:</strong>  The final keyword comes in handy If any restriction is required for classes, variables, or methods. Overriding of a final method is blocked by the use of the final keyword. The variable value becomes fixed.</p>

                                    <li><strong>String Pool: </strong>Developers of Java were aware of the fact that String data type is going to be majorly used by the programmers and developers. Thus, They came up with the notion of using the String pool to store the String literals. They intended to decrease the temporary String object with the help of sharing. The sharing of the mutable structures between two distinct parties is not possible. So, immutable Java String helps in executing the concept of String Pool.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Collections:</strong> In cases such as  Hashtables and HashMaps, keys are String objects. If the String objects are not immutable, then it can get advanced during the period when it resides in the HashMaps.</li>

                                <p>In Java, a string is basically immutable i.e. it cannot be further advanced. After its declaration, it continues to stay in the string pool until it is not removed in the form of garbage. To be brief, a string resides in the heap section of the memory for an unregulated and unspecified time interval after string value processing is executed.</p>

                                <p>Java always works as a “pass by value”. There is no term such as “pass by reference” in the language. But, when the object is passed in any method, the address of the value is passed due to the nature of object handling in Java. When an object is passed, a copy of the reference is created by Java and that is passed to the method.</p>

                                <p>StringBuffer is mutable and quite dynamic in nature whereas String is immutable. Every update of String creates a new String thereby putting excess pressure on the string pool with unnecessary objects. Thus, in cases where there are a lot of updates, it is always advised to use StringBuffer as it will reduce the overhead of the creation of multiple String objects in the string pool.</p>

                                    <li>Multiple-inheritance is not possible in Java. Classes can only extend from one superclass. In cases where multiple functionalities are required, for example - to read and write information into the file, the pattern of composition is preferred. The writer, as well as reader functionalities, can be made use of by considering them as the private members</li>

                                    <li>Composition assists in attaining high flexibility and prevents breaking of encapsulation </li>

                                    <li>Unit testing is possible with composition and not inheritance. When a developer wants to test a class composing a different class, then Mock Object can be created for signifying the composed class to facilitate testing. This technique is not possible with the help of inheritance as the derived class cannot be tested without the help of the superclass in inheritance.</li>

                                    <li>The loosely coupled nature of composition is preferable over the tightly coupled nature of inheritance </li>
