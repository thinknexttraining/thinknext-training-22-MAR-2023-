For example, if you're interviewing at a newly opened company, you'll likely be expected to shine within a quick environment and perform multiple task at a smaller team. So talk about ways you've stepped outside of your current job description to take on more opportunities and grow your skill set. If you're needed to be able to report on data sets, speak to your experience collecting and analyzing data and explain how you've run reports in the past. For content-focused roles, your writing experience  will be quite useful. Be sure to address the various ways you have worked with materials and the strategies you've used to get results

This sort of career–oriented mindset is highly attractive to interviewers seeking a candidate who knows why this role is right for them at this time and who will continue to learn and grow at their company. Prepare your answer to this questions prior, so you avoid rambling and can highlight your proudest achievements and best skills.
