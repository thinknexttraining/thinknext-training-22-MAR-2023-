                        Are you finding it difficult to hire the right person for the right job 
                        especially when it comes to freshers?</h3>

    <br /> 
                   <p align="justify">That&#39;s not surprising really, considering the huge gap between what is 
                    taught at local IT colleges and the actual requirements of the job. At ThinkNEXT we 
                    went through exactly the same thing. In fact we faced a serious hiring crunch; 
                    investment in training of fresh graduates was becoming an increasingly large 
                    drain on time and money. That&#39;s when we decided to do something about it.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    We started our 6 Month Industrial Training courses. After all we know what is 
                    required at the typical IT company, current technologies and the skills needed. 
                    We designed a curriculum around these requirements and flagged off the pilot 
                    courses to make fresh graduates eminently industry ready. The courses took off 
                    like a rocket – today they get filled within days!<br />
                    <br />
                    Our courses are high quality, taught by professionally certified faculty with a 
                    lot of emphasis on lab work and live projects. Our well trained ThinkNEXT graduates 
                    are industry-ready, competent in technologies like .Net, PHP, Java, iPhone and 
                    Android. The best part? Due to intensive schooling in soft skills and corporate 
                    communication at ThinkNEXT,our students actually communicate quite well. </p>
