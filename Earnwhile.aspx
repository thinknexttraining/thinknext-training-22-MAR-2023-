    As part of our “Earn while you Learn program”, we offer each student part-time 
    job offer during six months and above training program so that during training, 
    students would be able to manage their accommodation, food and miscellaneous 
    expenses on their own.

    during six months/six weeks industrial training from ThinkNEXT can earn Rs. 
    3500/- to 6000/- depending upon the communication skills, qualification, talent,
