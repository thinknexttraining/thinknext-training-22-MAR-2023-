                        <p><strong><a class="text-decoration-none" href="https://www.thinknexttraining.com/Autocad-training-in-chandigarh.aspx">AutoCAD is a Computer-aided Design (CAD)</a></strong> software application that lets users create precise designs in 2D and 3D to meet the requirements of a broad range of types of projects. If you've ever seen a blueprint-style sketch, it's likely that it was designed using AutoCAD. <strong>AutoCAD</strong> allows users to draw lines, circles as well as other designs in extremely exact dimensions. This lets the designer understand how the items look in real life without having to create prototypes in a lot of cases. Designers can make their designs printable as construction and fabrication drawings. <strong>AutoCAD</strong> also lets you create design concepts in 3D and use photorealistic materials and lighting to produce realistic impressions of art.</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="text-danger fw-bold">What Can You Use AutoCAD For?</h2>
