                            <p>Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained using labeled datasets. The model learns to make predictions by correlating the input data with the labeled data. Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained using unlabeled datasets. The model learns to make predictions by detecting patterns in the data.</p>

                            <p>A data scientist is someone who is well-versed in both technical and analytical skills. They are able to analyze large datasets and develop predictive models to solve complex problems. A data analyst is someone who uses data to gain insights and make decisions.
