                            <h3 class="h4 text-danger fw-bold">Start with the Basics </h3>
                            <p> Before you can begin to learn Python basics programming, you need to get a basic understanding of how programming works. This means learning the syntax and how to write and debug code. Fortunately, there are lots of great tutorials, books, and online courses available to help you get started.</p>                            

                        </div>
                        <br />

                        <div id="list2">
                            <h4 class="text-danger fw-bold">Use the Python Interpreter</h4>
                           <p>Once you have a basic understanding of Python programming, you can start experimenting with the Python interpreter. The Python Interpreter is an interactive environment for running Python scripts and commands. It provides a rich set of features that make it very easy for beginners to learn and use the language. </p>
<p> The Python Interpreter also provides support for debugging and profiling your code, as well as providing access to various libraries and frameworks. One of the most powerful features of the Python Interpreter is its ability to interpret Python scripts. This lets you run Python code directly within the interpreter, without having to compile it first. This makes it much easier to explore and experiment with the language, while still retaining the portability of the code.

                            <h4 class="text-danger fw-bold">Learn the Standard Library</h4>
                            <p>Python has a large standard library of code that can be used to build applications. Learning the standard library is a great way to become familiar with the language and its capabilities.</p>
 <p>This includes powerful libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and Pandas, as well as popular frameworks such as Django, Flask, and Pyramid. With the help of these libraries and frameworks, you can easily develop complex applications in Python</p>

                            <h4 class="text-danger fw-bold">Learn Object</h4>
                            <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a popular programming paradigm used in Python and many other languages. It involves creating and manipulating objects, which are data structures with methods and attributes. While there are a variety of programming paradigms available, OOP is often preferred because it makes code easier to read, maintain, and scale. </p>
                            <p>In order to understand OOP, it's important to first understand the concept of an object. An object is a data structure that contains attributes and methods, which are the instructions associated with the object. Objects can interact with each other and are often used to represent real-world items, such as a car or a person. </p>
                            <p>In Python, objects are created using classes. A class is a template used to create objects. It defines the attributes of the object and the methods that can be used on it. Classes are often used to create similar objects, such as a list of people or a list of cars.  </p>

                            <p>The only way to become a better programmer is to practice. You should try to write as much code as possible and make mistakes along the way. This will help you learn the language faster and become a better programmer.</p>
