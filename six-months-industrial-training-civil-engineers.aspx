<p>ThinkNEXT Technologies provides best Six Months Industrial Training opportunity for Civil Engineering Students.<br /><br />
This program is Job oriented training program after completion of this program, Civil engineer can start their career as a Civil Project Engineer, Civil Structural Engineer or Structural Design Engineer.</p>
<br /><h3>Technology 1: Structural Design</h3>
<p>Structural engineering is engineering discipline that deals with the analysis and design of structures that support or resist loads. Structural engineering is usually considered as a sub discipline of civil engineering, but it can also be studied in its own right.
<br /><br />
Structural engineers work is mostly designing of buildings and large non building structures, but they can also be work in designing of machinery, medical equipment, vehicles or any item where structural integrity affects the item's function or safety. The designs of Structural engineers must satisfy given design criteria, predicated on safety (e.g. structures must not collapse without due warning) or serviceability and performance (e.g. building sway must not cause discomfort to the occupants).
<br /><br />
Structural engineering implies the theory that is based on physical laws and empirical knowledge of the structural performance of different materials and geometries. A number of simple structural elements are utilized by Structural engineers to build complex structural systems. Structural engineers are responsible for making creative and efficient use of funds, structural elements and materials to achieve these goals.</p>
<br /><h3>Technology 2: Site Construction</h3>
<p>This field is related to architecture and civil engineering, process of assembling of infrastructure is known as construction. Far from being a single activity, large scale construction is result of of human multitasking. Normally project manager is required to manage the project , and supervision is done by a construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project architect. Effective planning is very much necessary for the successful execution of a project .Those Engineers that are involved with the design and execution of the infrastructure must consider the environmental impact, the successful scheduling, budgeting, construction site safety, availability of building materials, logistics, inconvenience to the public caused by construction delays and bidding, etc.
