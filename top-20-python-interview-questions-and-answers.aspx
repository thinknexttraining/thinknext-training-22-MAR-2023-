                            <p>A list is an ordered collection of objects that can be changed, while a tuple is an immutable collection of objects that cannot be changed once created. A list is denoted by square brackets ([]) and a tuple is denoted by parentheses (()).</p>

                            <p>An array is a data structure used to store multiple values of the same type, while a list is a collection of objects of any type. Arrays are more efficient than lists, because they are more space-efficient and have faster access times.</p>

                            <p>A dictionary is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. To create a dictionary, use curly brackets ({}) and a colon (:) to separate the key and value. For example, {"name": "John"} creates a dictionary with the key "name" and the value "John".</p>
